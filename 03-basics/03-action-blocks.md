# Action Blocks

In "Agent" mode, tasks are built from a sequence of actions. These actions are executed sequentially by the browser.

## Basic Actions

### **Click**

Simulates a left-click on an element. Use this to interact with buttons, links, or any clickable item.

- **Selector**: The CSS selector of the target element (e.g., `#btn`, `.link`).
- **Wait**: Optional delay (in seconds) after clicking.

### **Type**

Types text into an input field. Use this for filling out forms or search bars.

- **Selector**: The target input (e.g., `input[name="q"]`).
- **Value**: The text to type. Can include `{$variables}`.
- **Mode**: `Replace` (clears existing text) or `Append` (adds to end).

### **Wait**

Pauses execution for a fixed duration. Use this when you need a simple delay, though **Wait for Element** is often more reliable.

- **Value**: Duration in seconds (e.g., `2.5`).

### **Select** (`select`)

Selects an option from a `<select>` dropdown menu. Use this to interact with forms that require a specific choice from a dropdown.

- **Selector**: The CSS selector of the `<select>` element.
- **Value**: The value of the option to select. Can include `{$variables}`.

### **Wait for Selector** (`wait_selector`)

Waits until a specific element appears in the DOM. Use this to ensure the page has loaded the content you need before proceeding.

- **Selector**: The element to wait for.
- **Value**: Timeout in seconds (default: 30).

### **Press** (`press`)

Simulates a keyboard key press. Use this for navigation keys like `Enter`, `Tab`, or `Escape`.

- **Key**: The key name (e.g., `Enter`, `Tab`, `Escape`, `ArrowDown`).
- **Selector**: (Optional) Focus this element before pressing.

### **Scroll**

Scrolls the page or a specific element. Use this to reveal content that loads on scroll (lazy loading).

- **Selector**: (Optional) The element to scroll. If empty, scrolls the window.
- **Value**: Pixels to scroll (e.g., `500`) or specific commands (`bottom`, `top`).

### **Hover**

Moves the mouse cursor over an element. Use this to trigger dropdown menus or tooltips.

- **Selector**: The target element.

### **Navigate To**

Redirects the browser to a new URL. Use this to start a flow or move to a different page.

- **Value**: The full URL (e.g., `https://example.com/login`).

## Logic & Flow Control

### **If** (`if` / `else` / `end`)

Conditional execution block. Use this to handle dynamic situations, like closing a popup only if it appears.

- **Condition**: A JavaScript expression (e.g., `exists('.error')`).
- **Selector**: (Structured mode) Target element.
- **Operator**: `equals`, `contains`, `exists`, etc.

### **While** (`while` / `end`)

Repeats a block of actions while a condition is true. Use this for pagination or waiting for a specific state change.

- **Condition**: Same as `if`.
- **Value**: (Optional) Max iterations to prevent infinite loops.

### **For Each** (`foreach` / `end`)

Iterates over a list of elements. Use this to scrape lists of items, like search results or product cards.

- **Selector**: The elements to iterate (e.g., `.product-item`).
- **Var Name**: Variable to store the current element index/data.

### **Repeat N** (`repeat` / `end`)

Repeats a block N times. Use this when you know exactly how many times an action needs to happen.

- **Value**: Number of repetitions.

## Advanced Actions

### **JavaScript** (`javascript`)

Executes custom JavaScript in the browser context. Use this for complex logic, data extraction, or interactions not supported by other blocks.

- **Value**: The JS code (e.g., `return document.title;`).
- **Output**: The return value is stored in `block.output` for subsequent steps.

### **Screenshot**

Takes a screenshot at the current state. Use this for debugging or keeping records of the task execution.

- **Value**: (Optional) Filename suffix.
- **Selector**: (Optional) Capture only this element.

### **Stop Task**

Immediately stops the task execution. Use this to end the task early based on a condition (e.g., login success).

- **Value**: Exit status (e.g., `success`, `failure`).

### **Set Variable** (`set`)

Updates a runtime variable. Use this to store calculations or flags for later use.

- **Var Name**: The variable to update (e.g., `counter`).
- **Value**: The new value (can be a JS expression).

### **Wait for Downloads** (`wait_downloads`)

Waits for file downloads to complete. Use this after clicking a download button to ensure the file is saved.

- **Value**: Timeout in seconds.

### **On Error** (`on_error`)

Defines a block of actions to run if an error occurs in the main flow. Use this to implement retry logic or graceful failures (try/catch).

### **CSV** (`csv`)

Parses CSV formatted text into rows (an array of objects). Use this to extract data out of comma separated text for further processing.

- **Value**: The CSV text to parse. If left blank, it will attempt to use the output of the previous block (`block.output`).

### **Merge** (`merge`)

Merges multiple arrays, objects, or primitive values into a single output. Use this when you have collected data from different steps and need to combine them into one payload.

- **Value**: Comma-separated list of values or variables to merge (e.g., `items, extraItems, {$block.output}`).
- **Target Variable**: (Optional) The name of a new or existing variable to store the merged result (e.g., `allItems`).

### **Start Task** (`start`)

Triggers another task to run from within the current task. Use this to create modular workflows by chaining tasks together.

- **Task**: The ID of the task to run.
