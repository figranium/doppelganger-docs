# Multi-Architecture Installation (Git Clone)

This guide covers the secondary installation method for Figranium, which is suitable for all architectures (x86_64, ARM64, etc.) by building the Docker image locally.

While the primary and recommended installation method is using the pre-built images from [GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)](01-docker-compose.md), this method provides a reliable fallback for environments where pre-built images might not be optimal or available.

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

## Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the Figranium repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/figranium/figranium.git
cd figranium
```

### 2. Build and Start with Docker Compose

Run the following command to build the image locally and start the application in detached mode:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

This command will:

1.  Download the necessary base images.
2.  Compile the Figranium source code and build the Docker image for your specific architecture.
3.  Start the containers as defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### 3. Access the Application

Once the build is complete and the containers are running, open your browser and navigate to:

[http://localhost:11345](http://localhost:11345)

## Updating the Installation

To update your installation to the latest version, pull the latest changes from the repository and rebuild the image:

```bash
git pull origin main
docker compose up --build -d
```

## Comparison with GHCR (Primary Method)

| Feature | GHCR (Primary) | Git Clone (Secondary) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Speed** | Faster (Downloads pre-built image) | Slower (Builds image locally) |
| **Ease of Use** | High (Single `docker-compose.yml`) | Medium (Requires `git clone`) |
| **Architecture** | Supports common architectures | Supports all architectures |
| **Customization** | Limited to environment variables | Full access to source code |

We recommend using the [GHCR method](03-docker-image.md) whenever possible, as it is faster and more streamlined. Use this Git Clone method if you encounter architecture-related issues or need to modify the source code.
