# Installation with Docker Compose (Recommended)

This guide covers the recommended installation method using Docker Compose. This ensures a consistent environment across different platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) and simplifies dependency management.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included with Docker Desktop).

## Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. Create a Project Directory

Create a directory for your Figranium installation and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir figranium-server
cd figranium-server
```

### 2. Create `docker-compose.yml`

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in your project directory:

```yaml
services:
  figranium:
    image: ghcr.io/figranium/figranium:latest
    container_name: figranium
    ports:
      - "11345:11345"
      - "54311:54311"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
      - ./captures:/app/public/captures
    environment:
      - PORT=11345
      - SESSION_SECRET=your_secure_random_string
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### 3. Start with Docker Compose

Run the following command to start the application in detached mode:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This command will:

1.  Pull the Figranium Docker image from GHCR.
2.  Start the container and map the necessary ports.
3.  Mount local directories to persist your tasks, settings, and captures.

### 4. Access the Application

Once the container is running, open your browser and navigate to:

[http://localhost:11345](http://localhost:11345)

You should see the setup screen.

## Managing the Container

### View Logs

To view the application logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

### Stop the Application

To stop the container:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Update the Application

To update to the latest version, pull the latest image and restart:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

## Volume Persistence

Figranium uses volume mounts to ensure your data persists even if you delete the container.

- `./data`: Stores `tasks.json`, `proxies.json`, `settings.json`, and execution logs.
- `./captures`: Stores screenshots and recordings.

If you need to backup your data, simply copy these folders.
